                        target="_blank">Sholeh Wolpé</a> (an Iranian writer) is 
                        the first woman who 
                        translated Forugh Farrokhzad’s 
                        poems into English. She believes 
                        that Forugh Farrokhzad 
                        created a new path in poetry in 
                        Iran regarding feminist 
                        issues which no female poet did before her in 
                        sexual, political, emotional poems. There were some poems 
                        from a feminine perspective, but they were from a male point 
                        of view, so what Forugh did, was to take that on, and say no, 
                        we women have our own perspective, and of course, she paid for 
                        it for a long time. Sholeh mentions that I used to read 
                        Farrokhzad’s poems when I was a young girl, and her book 
                        was the only one that I brought from Iran and then as an 
                        adult, I began to read her work, I realized that there are 
                        many layers in her poetry, that is the brilliance of her 
                        poetry, you can read her poems and think you understand, 
                        but when you read it at an older age, the meaning changes. 
                        Her poems are very seemingly simple but multilayered. 
                        In fact, I spent two years translating 41 of her poems and I just poured my heart and soul into it.

                        Because, I somehow lived the 
                        emotional life that she lived and I 
                        had the parallel life in my own way, so 
                        I could establish the connection. After my 
                        translation was published the “Sin”, there 
                        was an explosion of interest in Forugh 
                        Farrokhzad, the English-speaking world 
                        became familiar with her, Iranian people 
                        became reacquainted with her because they 
                        were reading her poems in another language. 
                        What surprises me is when I got a letter 
                        from a male student, who writes me and says 
                        thank you for translating this Iranian poet 
                        because she changed my life. And I think to 
                        myself that is the power of poetry. The 
                        mid-twentieth century female poet 
                        struggling and writing in Iran, and 
                        her writings have so much power and 
                        so much depth, that this young man 
                        in mid-America in the twenty-first 
                        century is connecting with her work. 
                        And I tell you where ever I read her 
                        work, people were mesmerized, she is 
                        a remarkable woman. Sholeh believes 
                        that poem is the bridge that poets 
                        take advantage of it to connect people 
                        to each other and Forugh did it very well.
